Please see wireframes for rough draft

# What do I want the functionality of each page to be?

Please see user flow diagram/Mural documentation

# What is the purpose of my application?

- The purpose of my application is to assist with the timebinding/organizing of real world activities referenced to a real world scheduling document

# What business problem or real world problem am I going to be solving?

- Consolidating information from different sources to produce a customized output for a niche hobby

# Define the attributes of your website

Color Palette – on coloors

# List Applications Researched: (links to websites / applications)

https://battlescribe.net/?tab=news

# List what you like about each site:

- Army availability, compatibility to games

- Well designed

# List what you do not like about each site:

- Army building sites do not link to a localized schedule of when/where to play the games

- There is no scheduling app with a customized profile for tabletop strategy/roleplaying games

# How my application will be different:

- Combining a lightweight army builder with a scheduler will make it much easier for people to find games
